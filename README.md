This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Elixir related to the use of Enum.reduce with lists containing non-numeric elements. The `bug.exs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.exs` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to perform arithmetic operations on a non-numeric type within the Enum.reduce function.  The solution involves adding robust type checking.
